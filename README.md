### Organization 

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders.

- **Data/**: This folder includes intermediate and processed summary data that enable replication of most the figures and numbers cited in the text. Some of the files for the raw observational data are quite large, so they are not provided here.

- **Scripts/**: Code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in this folder. Scripts are written primarily in Python and R used for the empirical regression analysis.

- **Figures/**: Figures are saved here. Original figures will be saved if you run the scripts. Postprocessing in Adobe Illustrator was used occasionally. Also note that these scripts do not produce the tables found in the Supplementary Material. The tables were made in Microsoft word.


### Data 

The full data for the dengue estimates are large, on the order of gigabytes, so they are not hosted in this repo. If you'd like any other data that isn't provided here, please don't hesitate to let me know.

### Scripts

Core scripts of this article are embedded in an R Markdown document **MainCode_enso-dengue**
